Unlike general-purpose AI, it comes pre-trained and fine-tuned to strictly act as a pedagogical aid, providing hints, explanations, and guiding questions rather than direct answers, thereby preventing academic dishonesty. Its core strength lies in its deep specialization: the base AI model can be layered with content specific to a district's curriculum, a school's policies, a class's syllabus, and even an individual teacher's notes and assignments. Students interact with it via a seamless browser extension or standalone chatbot, while teachers and administrators gain comprehensive control dashboards for content upload (potentially automated from LMS like Canvas), usage monitoring, student learning trends, and providing feedback to further refine the AI's behavior. The goal is to provide ethical, personalized learning support while ensuring academic integrity within the educational ecosystem.",
